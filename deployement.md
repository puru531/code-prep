# Final Setup and Deployment

We've successfully completed the integration of the frontend with the real backend API. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished and what remains to be done:

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Backend Setup:
- Created MongoDB models for users, courses, and topics
- Implemented RESTful APIs for all resources
- Added JWT authentication with role-based authorization
- Created database seeder for demo data
- Set up proper error handling

### 2. Frontend Integration:
- Updated environment configuration to point to the real backend
- Modified services to work with the real API
- Added an authentication HTTP interceptor for JWT handling
- Implemented a model adapter service to handle MongoDB _id conversions
- Created an error service for user-friendly notifications

### 3. Documentation:
- Added detailed README with setup instructions
- Documented API endpoints for future reference

## Running the Application

To run the application, you'll need to:

1. Start MongoDB on your local machine (or connect to a MongoDB Atlas instance)
2. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ng serve
   ```

## Test Users

Once you've seeded the database with the provided data, you can log in with these credentials:

- **Admin user**: admin@codeprep.com / admin123
- **Regular user**: user@codeprep.com / user123

## Possible Next Steps

1. **Add Angular Material**: You may need to install Angular Material for the error service snackbar to work correctly:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ng add @angular/material
   ```

2. **Implement Frontend Caching**: Consider adding a caching layer to reduce API calls for frequently accessed data.

3. **Add Loading States**: Implement loading indicators while API requests are in progress.

4. **Update Security**: Further enhance security by implementing:
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation

5. **Test Coverage**: Add unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.

6. **Implement Pagination**: For better performance when dealing with large datasets.

## MongoDB Atlas Setup (Optional)

If you want to use MongoDB Atlas instead of a local MongoDB instance:

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account at [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Create a new cluster (the free tier is sufficient)
3. Set up network access to allow connections from your IP address
4. Create a database user with read/write privileges
5. Get your connection string from the Atlas dashboard
6. Update your `.env` file with the MongoDB Atlas connection string:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/codeprep?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

## Deployment Options

### Backend Deployment:

1. **Heroku**:
   ```
   heroku create codeprep-api
   git subtree push --prefix backend heroku main
   ```

2. **Render**:
   - Create a new Web Service
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Set the root directory to `/backend`
   - Set the build command: `npm install`
   - Set the start command: `npm start`
   - Add environment variables

### Frontend Deployment:

1. **Vercel**:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   cd frontend
   vercel
   ```

2. **Netlify**:
   ```
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   cd frontend
   ng build
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

## Environment-Specific Configuration

### Production Environment (frontend/src/environments/environment.prod.ts):
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  apiUrl: 'https://your-api-domain.com/api' // Replace with your actual production API URL
};
```

Remember to build the Angular application for production before deploying:
```
cd frontend
ng build --configuration production
```
